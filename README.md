# WiggleFormer: finetuned Generative Pre-Trained Transformer for infant movement analysis 

**Code coming soon**

**Step 1:** 2D keypoint estimtion with MMDetection & MMPose ([OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab))   
**Step 2:** 2D keypoint format conversion  
**Step 3:** 3D Skinned Multi-Infant Model (SMIL) fitting (adapted from: [Infant Pose Estimation](https://github.com/ostadabbas/Infant-Pose-Estimation))  
**Step 4:** Infant motion processing (adapted from: [HumanML3D](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/HumanML3D))  
**Step 5:** GPT training (adapted from: [MotionGPT](https://github.com/OpenMotionLab/MotionGPT))
